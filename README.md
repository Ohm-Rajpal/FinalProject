# FinalProject

This is Ohm Rajpal's final project for AP Computer Science A. We were given the option to make any project we wanted, 
as long as it had searching or sorting algorithms, the use of a data structure, and user input.

I decided to create a stats program that can output the solution to statistics problems involving chi-square goodness of fit,
homogeneity, or independence. The program can figure out what the problem is based on the responses of the user, and either tells
the test cannot be applied, or gives a summary of:

  1. The expected value array (1D or 2D)
  2. The chi-square value
  3. The degrees of freedom
  4. The calculated P-value
  5. A statistical summary based on the P-value compared to Î±
